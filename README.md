# Random Quote Project
The goal of the Codecademy project is to generate a random motivational quote.

**What I will need:**
* A way to store my code, edit my code, and publish my code. I plan to use VS and Github. I will also need to track my work with git.
* A list of quotes
* A system to pick a quote randomly, that makes sure that the new quote is different than the previous quote.
* A user interface to request a new quote.
* A user interface to display the new quote, and hide the old quote.
* A css file to store the styles of the user interface.
* A JS file to store the logic of listening to the trigger, get a random quote, and show it on the user interface.

**File system**
* quotes.js is there to store the quotes, and know how many quotes there are. At least thats the plan for now.
* logic.js is there to generate a randome quote, different from existing quote.
* index.html is there to show the quote and enable users to get a new quote. I'll also need a way to show no quotes if there are none that were previously generated.
* style.css is there to make things pretty on the html file.
