# Random Quote Project
The goal of the Codecademy project is to generate a randome motivational quote.

**What I will need:**
* A way to store my code, edit my code, and publish my code. I plan to use VS and Github. I will also need to track my work with git.
* A list of quotes
* A system to pick a quote randomly, that makes sure that the new quote is different than the previous quote.
* A user interface to request a new quote.
* A user interface to display the new quote, and hide the old quote.
